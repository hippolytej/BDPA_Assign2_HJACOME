Set-Similarity Joins

## Pre-processing
The goal is to pre-process the document corpus of pg100.txt (from http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt) to have only lines of unique words sorted by global frequency, excluding stopwords and clear of special characters.

To this end, we use the stopwords.csv file from assignment 1 as well as the wordcount.txt file from assignment 0, with format "word#count" for parsing purposes.

We also implement a counter that fetches the total number of lines.
